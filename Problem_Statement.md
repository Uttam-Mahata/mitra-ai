# Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness
Design an AIâ€‘powered, confidential, and empathetic mental wellness solution that supports and guides youth in overcoming stigma and accessing help.

# Challenge
Mental health remains a significant societal taboo in India, creating a formidable barrier for young adults and students seeking support. Amidst intense academic and social pressures, these individuals often lack a confidential, accessible, and non-judgmental outlet to address their mental health concerns. The existing landscape of professional mental healthcare is often out of reach due to high costs, limited availability, and the pervasive social stigma associated with seeking help.

# Objective
Leverage Google Cloud's generative AI to create innovative and impactful solutions that address the mental wellness needs of Indian youth. Participants are encouraged to think beyond traditional approaches and design systems, applications, or platforms that can serve as a supportive resource. Solutions should aim to promote emotional well-being, provide accessible information, and help destigmatize mental health discussions in a culturally sensitive manner.
