Grounding with Google Search

Grounding with Google Search connects the Gemini model to real-time web content and works with all available languages. This allows Gemini to provide more accurate answers and cite verifiable sources beyond its knowledge cutoff.

Grounding helps you build applications that can:

Increase factual accuracy: Reduce model hallucinations by basing responses on real-world information.
Access real-time information: Answer questions about recent events and topics.
Provide citations: Build user trust by showing the sources for the model's claims.

Python
JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

# Configure the client
client = genai.Client()

# Define the grounding tool
grounding_tool = types.Tool(
    google_search=types.GoogleSearch()
)

# Configure generation settings
config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    tools=[grounding_tool]
)

# Make the request
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="Who won the euro 2024?",
    config=config,
)

# Print the grounded response
print(response.text)

How grounding with Google Search works
When you enable the google_search tool, the model handles the entire workflow of searching, processing, and citing information automatically.

grounding-overview

User Prompt: Your application sends a user's prompt to the Gemini API with the google_search tool enabled.
Prompt Analysis: The model analyzes the prompt and determines if a Google Search can improve the answer.
Google Search: If needed, the model automatically generates one or multiple search queries and executes them.
Search Results Processing: The model processes the search results, synthesizes the information, and formulates a response.
Grounded Response: The API returns a final, user-friendly response that is grounded in the search results. This response includes the model's text answer and groundingMetadata with the search queries, web results, and citations.
Understanding the Grounding Response
When a response is successfully grounded, the response includes a groundingMetadata field. This structured data is essential for verifying claims and building a rich citation experience in your application.

          },
          {

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
The Gemini API returns the following information with the groundingMetadata:

webSearchQueries : Array of the search queries used. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process.
searchEntryPoint : Contains the HTML and CSS to render the required Search Suggestions. Full usage requirements are detailed in the Terms of Service.
groundingChunks : Array of objects containing the web sources (uri and title).
groundingSupports : Array of chunks to connect model response text to the sources in groundingChunks. Each chunk links a text segment (defined by startIndex and endIndex) to one or more groundingChunkIndices. This is the key to building inline citations.
Grounding with Google Search can also be used in combination with the URL context tool to ground responses in both public web data and the specific URLs you provide.

Attributing Sources with inline Citations
The API returns structured citation data, giving you complete control over how you display sources in your user interface. You can use the groundingSupports and groundingChunks fields to link the model's statements directly to their sources. Here is a common pattern for processing the metadata to create a response with inline, clickable citations.

Python
JavaScript

def add_citations(response):
    text = response.text
    supports = response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.grounding_supports
    chunks = response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks

    # Sort supports by end_index in descending order to avoid shifting issues when inserting.
    sorted_supports = sorted(supports, key=lambda s: s.segment.end_index, reverse=True)

    for support in sorted_supports:
        end_index = support.segment.end_index
        if support.grounding_chunk_indices:
            # Create citation string like [1](link1)[2](link2)
            citation_links = []
            for i in support.grounding_chunk_indices:
                if i < len(chunks):
                    uri = chunks[i].web.uri
                    citation_links.append(f"[{i + 1}]({uri})")

            citation_string = ", ".join(citation_links)
            text = text[:end_index] + citation_string + text[end_index:]

    return text

# Assuming response with grounding metadata
text_with_citations = add_citations(response)
print(text_with_citations)
